# MovieLens-Insights: Data Engineering Project


This project showcases robust data engineering skills by building a comprehensive ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) pipeline for the MovieLens 1M dataset. The pipeline orchestrates various Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services and open-source tools to efficiently process, transform, and visualize data, demonstrating a full end-to-end data solution.


## Project Architecture

The following diagram illustrates the architecture of the ELT pipeline, highlighting the flow of data and the tools used at each stage:

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. Data Ingestion & Storage

* **MovieLens 1M dataset** files are initially uploaded to **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**, acting as the raw data landing zone.

### 2. Data Loading & Schema Definition

* **External tables** are created in **BigQuery**, directly referencing the raw data stored in GCS. This allows for querying the data without physically moving it into BigQuery's managed storage.

### 3. Data Transformation

* **dbt (data build tool)** is employed to apply a series of **transformations** to the data within BigQuery. 

The dbt transformation layer is organized into three logical layers: **staging**, **core**, and **analytics**, each serving a distinct purpose in preparing and enriching the MovieLens dataset for analysis.

#### ðŸ“¦ Staging Models

* Clean and standardize raw data from external tables (`ratings_external`, `movies_external`, `users_external`).
* Ensure correct datatypes, formats, and normalized naming conventions.
* Apply essential tests such as uniqueness, non-null constraints, and referential integrity.

#### ðŸ§  Core Models

* Build dimensional tables like `dim_movies_genres`, `dim_users`, and `dim_time`.
* Create fact tables such as `fact_ratings` that integrate user demographics, movie metadata, and rating data.
* Enrich user data with geographic information (city, state, county) by joining with ZIP code mappings from a seed file.
* Implement data quality tests to ensure reliability and consistency.

#### ðŸ“Š Analytics Models

* **`movie_leaderboard`**: Provides a leaderboard of top-rated movies with at least 50 ratings, ordered by average rating, to identify the most popular and critically acclaimed movies overall.
* **`movie_leaderboard_by_genre`**: Ranks movies within each genre by average rating and rating count, filtering to movies with at least 50 ratings. Supports genre-specific insights with rank ordering per genre.

### 4. Workflow Orchestration

* The entire ELT pipeline is **automated** using **Apache Airflow**, with the help of **Astronomer** for its managed services.
* **Cosmos** is integrated to further enhance the orchestration, especially for dbt projects within Airflow, ensuring a streamlined and efficient workflow execution.

### 5. Data Visualization

* A dynamic **dashboard** is built using **Looker Studio** to visualize the transformed data. This provides insightful analytics and allows for easy exploration of the MovieLens dataset.

### 6. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

* **Terraform** is utilized to **provision the necessary infrastructure** on Google Cloud Platform.
